  :description => 'Jahman Brahman is a genre bending band based out of Columbus, Ohio. With a diverse lineup of unique personalities, they attempt to leave no musical stone unturned. From December 2005 until December 2008 Jahman Brahman was four members: Casey Chanatry on guitar/vocals, Justin Brown on guitar/vocals, Nathan Brown on bass/vocals, and Rowdy Keelor on drums/vocals. With the recent addition of Josh Loffer on keys, Jahman Brahman has finally taken its complete shape. Wasting no time, they have been busy playing action-packed shows all around Central Ohio. With a love for both songwriting and improvisation, JB shows satisfy the masses with epic musical adventures as well as songs anyone could sing along to. Their influences range from Notorious B.I.G. to Ekoostik Hookah. From Barry White to Carlos Santana; from classic rock to electronica. A Jahman Brahman show offers a high-energy, interactive experience for all.'},
  {:title => 'Jahman Brahman Family',
  :description => 'Jahman Brahman is far more than five people, it is a family. It is the people they see at every show and the new friends they make every time. It is the people who travel with them and the people they travel to play for. With a mission to spread positive energy to as many people as possible, things are starting to come together for Jahman Brahman. We will be working hard to make each show a special party, but can\'t do it without you all! Spread the word and we will see you there.'}
